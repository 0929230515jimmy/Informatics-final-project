# Informatics-final-project
So far I have finished all the mutation and prepared all the data I need to create 
my webapp. I created my model and compared it to Osbourn's model. My model has a 
higher win percentage, so that means I am on the right track. The left over is that
I will need to put everything onto the webapp. The issue I ran into is mainly converting
ipynb to py file. The work I have done is in the data_clean file in the project folder.
